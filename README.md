# Classification
Classification is a supervised machine learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes or groups. It solves the problem of predicting the category or class of new, unseen data based on patterns learned from a training dataset. This is particularly useful in applications like spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis, and more.

## Types of Classifiers
**Decision Tree Classifier:** This method uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. It's intuitive and easy to visualize. Decision trees split the data into branches to arrive at a classification outcome.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN classifies data based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. It's simple and effective, especially for small datasets, and doesn't assume any underlying data distribution.

**Logistic Regression:** Despite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class using a logistic function.

**Naive Bayes Classifier:** This probabilistic classifier applies Bayes' Theorem with the assumption of independence between features. It's particularly fast and effective for large datasets and text classification tasks.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM):** SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes. It's powerful for both linear and non-linear classification problems and can handle high-dimensional data.
